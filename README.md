# final_year_project - Implementation of Neural Network-Based Control Scheme on Benchmark Conical Tank Level System
In this project, we basically worked on how a neural network-based controller can be designed and applied to control the water level of a conical tank level system. Here, the feed-forward back-propagation neural network is used to implement the architecture of the controller and then the network is trained using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to control the inlet flow of the liquid in order to maintain the desired level of liquid in the tank at a constant value. The actual output of the process is compared to the desired response obtained from a reference model, and based on the calculated error, the controller parameters are tuned so that the process output reaches the desired response within a finite time, even in the presence of external disturbances. The simulation results demonstrate that the controller achieves the desired performance for both the servo and regulatory response of the conical tank level system. These findings are valuable for the field of process control industries, as they demonstrate the potential for effective control of liquid levels in nonlinear tank systems.
